# AugmentikApp
This App allows user to upload images to AWS S3 Bucket Directly. 

## Retrieval of data
Retrieval of all images from s3 bucket directly had a problem because each image is not set to public. We'll have to set that manually.
So image retrieval didn't work but I'm finding alternate and trying to fix it.

## Labelling of Images
We can use VGG Annotator for labelling part of images.

## Tech Stack
React Native, Firebase, REST API, JavaScript, Amazon S3 Bucket, Sheetbest API.
